Open source code and its role in reproducible research is an issue that is both very necessary and very complicated to impliment.
Often in STEM classes students are asked to interrogate the assumptions made when preforming certain calculations, as I did just now with my geohcem homework.
Some assumptions make equations unworkable in some situations, and meaningless in others.
Moving beyond human assumption, often in research the models, data collection, and the computers themselves have assumption baked in.
Assuming that a reproducing study would have, or know the exact version of software, date of data collection, or acess to certain servers can and often does make reanalysis unworkable.

For my thesis I am committed to providing reproducible results.
To do this I am keeping a copy of my code, the software and packages I used, and using Professor Holler's git format for reproducible results.
Much of science relies on the assumption that results are replicable, one more assumption to keep in mind.

I feel terrible like nothings there

i cant even respond to my grandparents
so nervous about this assignment i cant complete
really warm

not feeling well

I had a missing file, and i got stuck on the part in the original code where the author mentioned file directories.
This meant that the code could only run properly on the author's computer, and nowhere else.
In trying to find the file I've looked back at the paper, and I assume it is a shapefile of the Fraser watershed.

In reformatting the code I learned to use the "here" package to indicate file loading and saving locations.
I will be using the here package to make my thesis analysis reproducible.

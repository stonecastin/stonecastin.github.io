For my exploration into OpenStreetMap's Dar Es Salaam data I choose to asess ambulance acess for all buildings within the city.
To do this I measured both the distance between the centroid of each building and the nearest road larger than a footpath, and the distance from the centroid of each building to the centroid of the nearest hospital.

My analysis is most valid for central city, as the most accurate and updated streetmap data is available there.

Exploratory study within the city of Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania.
Using OSM data collected from 2017 to present.

Ambulance access in Dar Es Slaam was based on buildings' distance to nearest passable road and distance to the nearest hospital / clinic.
Road access ranges from an average (per ward) distance of 75 m to a road  (Kimbiji) to 17 m to a road (Magomeni).
Distance to a hospital ranges from an average (per ward) distnce of over 2500 m to a hospital or clinic (Pemba Mnazi) to 208 m average distance to a hospital or clinic (Kisutu).

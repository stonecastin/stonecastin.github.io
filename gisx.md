title: CyberGISX and Open Collaboration
---

CyberGIS acts as a sort of social media for geography researchers, where they can share, comment on, and reproduce analysies created by their collegues.
One of the hopes of cyberGIS is that researchers will come to the platform from all disciplines, as many disciplines have geographic data.
A geographic study on COVID spread, like one discussed in class, could pull on expertise from epidemiologists and geographers, and create a model that avoids the geographers' incorrect assumptions about epidemeology, and the epidemiologists' incorrect understanding of geography.

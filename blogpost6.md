The Malawi study had significant issues with both the theoretical framework of its model and the data collected to run though the model.
The theoretical framework was not supported by data, but with meetings with stakeholders including the government and NGOs.
The ideas of what makes a stable and functioning household and even what "stability" is highly vary, and the forward looking model constructed in the paper can only be corroberated with future data.

The location error introduced in the placement of households is also a significant barrier to interpretation.
Instead of aggregating the household characteristics upward into the districts, which would have preserved privacy, the paper instead choose to randomly distribute households within a 5 km radius of the actual household point to address privacy concerns.
This is a huge problem as some households change districts, and some even end up in lakes or other non data units.

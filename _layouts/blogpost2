{{Learning how to code more complicated queries using SQL has made using QGIS that much more interesting.
Being able to read queries and understand what the output should be is very exciting, and much more challenging than the visual layout of QGIS tools.
Having more control over commands, and having my computer respond much faster than it would if I was rendering layer changes in real time, is going to be a handy tool for my thesis.
For my senior thesis I will be working with a large dataset of river quality data.
Being able to process the data, and handily keep a record of all changes and queries in an Atom document, will enable me to focus on data analysis as opposed to fumbling with Q or excel.
SQL represents another stripped away layer of abstraction that I spoke about in my first blog post.
I am thrilled to learn so much right away.}}

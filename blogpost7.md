In reproducing the Kang et al study we attempted to expand the road network around Chicago to account for those who would use the city hospitals but lived outside the city bounds.
This fix would improve accuracy as many outside of large metropolitan areas choose to go to hospitals outside of their "region" for one reason or another.
Data from sources like the census often looks at individuals as fixed points or aggregated into fixed polygons.
This is necessary for geographic analysis, though that assumption becomes an issue when movement complicates data.
In a previous project, I had to account for those working in Addison county VT, but living eslewhere.
Excluding New York state, for example, would have hampered my analysis.

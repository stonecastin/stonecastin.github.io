The full text of my thesis can be found [here](), and the full R analysis [here]().

For my environmental geology thesis I worked with River Watch of Addison County (ACRW) to answer a few important questions:

1. tbd, phrasing
2. Does dissolved phosphorus tell us something that other water quality variable do not?
3. Can dissolved phosphorus be predicted?

To answer these questions I used QGIS, R, and SQL.
SQL to format the data, (code [here]()), R to analyze and visualize the data, (code [here]()), and GIS to pull in watershed characteristics.
